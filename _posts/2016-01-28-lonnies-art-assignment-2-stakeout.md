Ta-daaaa! My first full [Art Assignment][0] comic! What do you think??? Please give me all of your feedbacks.

This comic is based on carrying out the Art Assignment's first art assignment entitled [Meet in the Middle][1], assigned by [Douglas Paulson][2] and [Christopher Robbins][3].

The next assignment will involve... spying.
